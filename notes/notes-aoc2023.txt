:section Day 01

   My son Isaac was watching me as I hurried to try and do the puzzles before
   taking him to school. He was more interested in the "story" for 2023. Puzzle
   1 was really quick and I was showing him the story and the code and hadn't
   scrolled down yet to see what puzzle 2 was about, but I correclty predicted
   to him that it would probably involve the "one" "two" etc that we were seeing
   in the sample input. That turned out to be correct.

   I _did_ notice that some of the words overlapped, but at first I didn't
   consider that valid: I thought "eightwo" should be parsed as "eight" "wo" and
   become only 8. Running my code on the sample data taught me that wasn't
   correct. Then I forgot that, for capture groups, re-seq returns a _vector_ of
   the matches. Unfortunately, my code still worked (in the sense that it didn't
   throw an exception) and just returned wrong values, so it took a while to
   realize.
