   My son Isaac was watching me as I hurried to try and do the puzzles before
   taking him to school. He was more interested in the "story" for 2023. Puzzle
   1 was really quick and I was showing him the story and the code and hadn't
   scrolled down yet to see what puzzle 2 was about, but I (correctly) predicted
   to him that it would probably involve parsing the "one" "two" etc that we
   were seeing in the sample input.

   I _did_ notice that some of the words overlapped, but at first I didn't
   consider that valid: I thought "eightwo" should be parsed as "eight" "wo" and
   become only 8. Running my code on the sample data taught me that wasn't
   correct. Then I forgot that, for capture groups, re-seq returns a _vector_ of
   the matches. Unfortunately, because I was 'str'-ingifying values in the
   middle of the transormation chain, my code still sort of worked (in the sense
   that it didn't throw an exception) but just returned wrong values, so it took
   a while to realize.

   Another way to do this, after reading some of the comments on Clojurians
   slack, is to just find the first match of "1|one|2|two..." and the _last_
   match "1|eno|2|owt|..." and then keep just those. This doesn't care about
   overlaps because you just need the first/outermost match.
