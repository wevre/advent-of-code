:section A puzzle

   bhauman has a function for generating subsets that is fast, and memoized. I'm
   not 100% sure I understand how it works. I need to walk through a few sample
   iterations to make sure it is solid in my brain.

   But, aside from understanding that, one flaw in his solution, and from
   reading Reddit, it is probably similar with many who solved this, there is no
   checking that a found subset still leaves the remaining numbers able to be
   divided into correct subsets. I liked how one Reddit poster laid out the
   issue, and I created my solution by following that outline.
