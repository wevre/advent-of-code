:section Introduction
   I'm already a few days in to AOC 2021, but I thought I'd jot a few notes
   here.

:section To Do's

   [] Redo Day-2 with using reduce (instead of loop-recur) and a function that
   switches on a condition based on the command. Also, a re-seq looking for \w+
   and \d+ can then be mapped into keyword and parseInt quite simply.

   [] Day_4 I had an idea to process each bingo card and return back how many
   turns before it won. That would have been a solution I could have used for
   both parts, maybe go back and redo it that way.

   [] I love my solutions for days 5 and 6 and haven't seen anything else out
   there that is better.

   [] Day 8 has a more elegant solution based on the overall frequencies of each
   segment for easy and other. Checking those frequencies on the random inputs,
   one can map back to original segment and then determine what the number is.
